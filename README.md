# Book Search Engine


## Description

This project's goal was to refactor a working application built with RESTful API into a working application based on a GraphQL API and Apollo Server.

When the user searches a book, the application will come up with a list of books based on that search from a Google API. When the user clicks on a book,  they should be able to see details about the book.

The user also has ability to log into the app.  When they do, they can save books they have searched and view the books they have saved in the application as well as delete books from their saved list.

The application helped me to learn how the MERN stack works with GraphQL.  It helped me learn how to build typeDef files, and resolvers composed of queries and mutations.  I practiced using the Apollo Studio Explorer to verify queries and mutations worked as expected, and transferred all previous api routes and controllers over to queries and mutations on the backside, as well as building the Apollo Server.  Once this was complete, I worked on refactoring the client side.
